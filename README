Teradata/BTET version 0.02
==========================

Teradata::BTET is a Perl interface to Teradata SQL. It does not attempt
to be a complete interface to Teradata -- for instance, it does not
allow multiple sessions, asynchronous requests, or PM/API
connections -- but it should be sufficient for many applications.
The syntax is similar to that of DBI, but this is not a DBI module.

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

   $dbh = Teradata::BTET::connect("dbc/bogart,bacall");
   $sth = $dbh->prepare("select * from edw.sales");
   $sth->open;
   while ( @row = $sth->fetchrow_list ) {
      ... process the row ...
   }
   $sth->close;
   $dbh->disconnect;

INSTALLATION

Before installing this module, define an environment variable named
TDLOGON. This should be a user ID on the Teradata server that is able
to select from DBC views.

   export TDLOGON=[server/]user,password

Then, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires:

   Perl version 5.6.0 or later
   a C compiler
   Teradata Preprocessor2 (PP2) for C

At present, the module has been tested only on Solaris, but it should
work on MP-RAS or other platforms with relatively few changes. Those who
are able to test it on MP-RAS, earlier versions of Perl, or other
platforms are welcome to collaborate.
